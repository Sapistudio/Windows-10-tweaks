# Windows-10-tweaks
This repo contains multiple scripts to optimize windows 10

Just lunch the **"ALL IN ONE Executor.bat"** and it will run all files but ***"Disable_Action_Center.reg"*** (if you want it aswell just add it to the **"ALL IN ONE Executor.bat"** file)

Â 

**Disable_Action_Center.reg**

Disables action center in the notification center

**OneDrive_Uninstaller_v1.2.bat**

Completely removes Microsoft OneDrive annoying bloatware

**QoS_Limiter.reg**

By default, Windows reserves 20% of the bandwidth for its specific services limiting thus your bandwidth to achieve its full potential, this reg tweak fixes that issue by removing that default limit

**SSD_Optimizations.reg**

Disables Prefetch and Superfetch services which are useless on a SSD based OS
